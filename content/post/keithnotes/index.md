I have been doing some improvisation theater for half of a decade now. In October 2018, I had the opportinity to participate in a 10 days Workshop with [Keith Johnstone](https://www.keithjohnstone.com/), one of the pioneers of improvisation.

During this workshop, I took notes, that I have reworked about a year later and expanded with some of my thougts. Everything is now available [here](keith.pdf). Hopefully, it will be of interest to those that know Keith Johnstone, to those that do not yet, and to those who think they know Keith Johnstone.

Disclaimer: those notes are my own retranscription of what I believe happened during the workshop. They are in no way a faithful retranscription, and some citations or thoughts may have been distorted. Keith may not be held accountable for any thoughts or citation appearing in those notes, and I may have hallucinated the whole thing.
