# Current Teachings

Sadly, I am not currently giving any course. See you soon!

# Ressources

A set of some old ressources, made for courses I've given.

## Formal models for Protocol security

When writing my [thesis](../../publication/thesis/thesis.pdf), I have provided
* in the Introduction a brief overview of all the building blocks of protocol security
* in the chapter "Formal models for Protocols", a pi-calculus with both symbolic and computational semantics, which is also used in combination with the BC logic.

This could probably serve as a base for an introduction to the formal security field.


## Tree automata techniques and applications

The course is about tree automata, and mostly based on the so called [TATA](http://tata.gforge.inria.fr/). The exercise sheets, and some partial solutions can be found bellow:
 * [TD1](tata/td1.pdf), [solutions](tata/td1_sol.pdf)
 * [TD2](tata/td2.pdf), [solutions](tata/td2_sol.pdf)
 * [TD3](tata/td3.pdf), [solutions](tata/td3_sol.pdf)
 * [TD4](tata/td4.pdf), [solutions](tata/td4_sol.pdf)
 * [TD5](tata/td5.pdf), [solutions](tata/td5_sol.pdf)

## Complexity

Some exercices about NL, PSPACE, PH and others.
 * [TD1](CA/td1.pdf), [solutions](CA/td1_sol.pdf)
 * [TD2](CA/td2.pdf), [solutions](CA/td2_sol.pdf)
 * [TD3](CA/td3.pdf), [solutions](CA/td3_sol.pdf)
 * [TD4](CA/td4.pdf), [solutions](CA/td4_sol.pdf)
 * [TD5](CA/td5.pdf), [solutions](CA/td5_sol.pdf)



## French "agregation", computer science option D

I've participated in redacting some short "cheatsheet", for each lesson of the concourse. See [here](https://charlie-j.github.io/agreg-fiches/) for more details (in French).
